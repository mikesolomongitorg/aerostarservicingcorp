Aerostar Servicing I want to thank you for changing my life.

            I was looking for a good lawyer and thought that I had found one. I thought that by the way he was talking he would be able to help me. In three months I talked to him twice. He said that everything was ok. He never did my modification, he never negotiated for me. He told me that he would not be able to help me and wasted so much time. My home was in foreclosure and my car was about to be repossessed. I ran into a friend and she told me about Aerostar Servicing Corp. She told me that they helped her in a way that she couldn't believe and also let her make payments. So I called them and it was like she said they were caring and honest and professional. Better than a Lawyer they made me feel like family. They took care of my circumstances and I felt relieved. Thank you Aerostar Servicing!
